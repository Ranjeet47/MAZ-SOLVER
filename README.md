# Maze-Solver
This is a maze solving project where a maze can be solved by 5 Famous Algorithms in Graph Theory and AI

In this Maze all the start, end and the walls are adjustable.
The differnt Algorithms used are:
1) DFS
2) BFS
3) Multi BFS
4) Dijkstras
5) A*

All the algorithms are written from scratch.
All the Visualizations are made using Pygame Module using python
